# Crypto Utilities

Repo to explore different types of encryption and hashing algorithms.

Difference between encryption and hashing:
* encryption is a 2-way function, meaning the function is reversible and the original input can be restored
* hashing is a mapping, which is 1-way and irreversible
  * can have multiple strings map to same hash, called a "collision", which should be infrequent if the hash algorithm is cryptographically secure

## Encryption

* AES 256
   * CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)

## Hashing

* BCRYPT
